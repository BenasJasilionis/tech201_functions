# Functions
The purpose of using functions is to follow D.R.Y : Dont, Repeat, Yourself
* The more you repeat yourself, the more complicated your program gets, which decreases readability
* Functions also make your code re-usable, so you don't have to keep re-writing lines of code every time you want to change a parameter

### Anatomy of a function
A function is created with the following syntax : `def function_name(arguments)`
1) The `def` phrase is the initiation of a function
2) The `function_name` is what your function will be called
3) The `(arguments)` can either be left empty, or specified with variables to utilise the true power of functions
